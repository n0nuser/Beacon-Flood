# Beacon-Flood
## USAGE
```bash
./beacon.sh wlan0 FILE/name
```
It let's you select a file where you have your own names or Generates 1000 APs preceded by the name you choose.<br>
It's used to disturb connections as it generates lot's of them, but it's illegal, so use on you own.<br>I don't take any responsability of the misuse of this script.<br>

## Changes
You can change the *1000* by the number of APs you want.<br>
Also you can remove the *$i* so it doesn't appear like: *New SSID 777*

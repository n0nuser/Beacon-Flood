# Beacon-Flood
Generates 1000 APs.<br>
It's used to disturb connections but it's illegal, so use on you own. I don't take any responsability of the misuse of this script.<br>

## Changes
You can change the *1000* by the number of APs you want.<br>
Also you can remove the *$i* so it doesn't appear like: *New SSID 777*
